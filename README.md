## Movie-Recommendation
This project aims to build a movie recommender system with the MovieLens 100k dataset using R.

#### Data
The MovieLens 100k dataset is available from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. 

The dataset describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users. 

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.
